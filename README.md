##### Project Description:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### This project expects one to be able to utilize Express.js API and configure it to use Mongoose as an ODM layer for interacting with the popular type of NoSQL Database: MongoDB in building the back end of an Social Network. The project expects all the CRUD API operations on social network entities after they are designed through the use of Mongoose Schema. Throught the schema relatioship, one also should be able to display resulted data through the use of MongoDB models/collections methods, along with the use of ref (join), entity populating option & fields' input-validations. There will be a walkthrough video as part of the end-result that demonstrates the back-end functionality which involve User, Friends, Thought, Reactions manipulations via the RESTful API CRUD endpoints in Insomnia
